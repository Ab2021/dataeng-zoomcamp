`TenantRoleTable`\r\n- Rename protobuf message `OmDBAccessInfo` to `ExtendedAccessIdInfo`\r\n- Use protobuf in `OmDBTenantInfo` and `OmDBKerberosPrincipalInfo`\r\n- Rename `OmDBKerberosPrincipalInfo` to `OmDBUserPrincipalInfo`\r\n- Move `isTenantAdmin()` from `OzoneManager` to `OMMultiTenantManagerImpl`\r\n  - Fix a bug where `listUsersInTenant` wasn't checking admin permission properly (didn't count the `omAdminUsernames` wildcard case)\r\n- Remove `TenantPolicyTable` (merged into `OmDBTenantInfo` as a new `policyNames` field)\r\n- Rename `OmDBTenantInfo` to `OmDBTenantState`\r\n\r\nSome

Introduce a\nflexible syntax for that option to allow arbitrary options to be\nspecified without needing to adjust the main replication grammar,\nand common code to parse it that is shared between the client and\nthe server.\n\nThis commit doesn't actually add any new compression parameters,\nso the only user-visible change is that you can now type something\nlike pg_basebackup --compress gzip:level=5 instead of writing just\npg_basebackup --compress gzip:5. However, it should make it easy to\nadd new options. If for example gzip starts offering fries, we can\nsupport pg_basebackup --compress gzip:level=5,fries=true for the\nbenefit of users who want fries with that.\n\nAlong the way, this fixes a few things in pg_basebackup so that the\npg_basebackup can be used with a server-side compression algorithm\nthat pg_basebackup itself does not understand.
